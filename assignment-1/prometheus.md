## Scenarios

### User (Bidder / Seller)

#### Sell an item

Given I have an item that I want to sell  
When I go to the service desk and provide  
  a minimum price,  
  the end date for the auction  
  and a description  
Then I should receive a unique id representing the auction  

#### Bid and search auction

Given I search for a car  
When I select any given car and make my bid  
Then I should be able get a proper responds whatever my bid was valid or not  
If my bid is the highest after auction end date  
Then I win the auction  

#### Make a bid

Given I provde the follow params  
  an auction id  
  and a minimum price  
Then I should receive a status code  

#### Search for item

Given a search string  
When I execute the query  
Then I should be able to see a list all matched auctions  

### Mediator

#### Create an valid bid

Given  
  an auction id,  
  a price,  
  a user id,  
When I add a valid bid  
Then I return a status code equal to success  

#### Create an in-valid bid

Given  
  an auction id,  
  a price,  
  a user id,  
When I add an in-valid bid  
Then I return a status code equal to failed  

#### Auction ends with bids

Given I'm on the next tick  
When I list all actions  
  marked as "not finished"  
  and end date > current date  
Then I should  
  notify the higest bidder and owner for each action  
  and mark the given action as closed  

### Searcher

#### Search for auction

Given I'm provided with a search query  
When I process the query and pass the information to the database  
Then I should be able to return a list of matched auctions  

## System goals

- it should be possible to ...
  - search for auctions
  - create auctions
  - bid on auctions
